i want to create PIS (passenger information system) which has the following features 1. Real-time bus data, 2. display arrival and departure times 3. show destination and status (if on time or delay) 4. bus type (express, local or VIP) and platform number, 5. bus number and route ID. 6. delay notification and status alerts. Additional to that show arrival time, current time, departure time and where to. Give modern look and professional frontend look for this system. use tailwindcss for fast styling and use html for layoutood now routes are Singida - Dar Es Salaam, Iringa - Dar Es Salaam and Dar Es Salaam - Dodoma, the company is ABC-upperclass. Also implement both swahili and English (you may use / to separate or any good way best to implement two languages). lastly the time implemented should be full, from date to seconds real time. The plate number of the bus is T 578 DXN (add those two plate numbers random but same format as given)
